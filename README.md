# Challenge4.github.io

I made a few mistakes that I would change if I were to re-do this assignment. 
first, I would add more questions, and I would make the buttons change colors if they were correct but that would be a lot more complicated than the current code because I would have to add a next button instead of the script being dynamic. 

I would also add local storage to be able to records high scores. 

and lastly, I would definetly give the repository a more unique and desricptive name.
